<!-- #### Why do I collect these snippets?

For usual snippets, we can find it on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions) or other sites. The problem is, we can't be sure if the most up voted answer is reliable enough. For example,

- how many cases the answer have considered?
- can this answer be any better?
- what about the compatibility?
- ...

It would be so nice if there is a test with the answer which can tell us how reliable the answer is.

For example, someone is asking for a method called `isElement` which can detect whether the param is an element. The best answer would be:

```js
function isElement() {
  //...
}
isElement(document) // true
isElement(document.documentElement) // true
isElement(document.createElement('svg')) // true
isElement(document.createDocumentFragment()) // false
isElement([]) // false
```

However, answer like this is not very common to see. Also, it seems too much for poster.

So, I made this snippets and add tests to make sure:

- it does work.
- it has tests to tell you how many cases it has covered.
- it would be better as long as it can.

#### What kind of snippets I don't collect?

- code like `ajax` or `getParamsFromUrl` or something with these. These codes normally have experimental API though the compatibility is not good enough. In this case, I thought we should use new API with polyfill instead of using old snippets.
- code not too common to use. -->
